To commemorate the (almost) one year anniversary of the post post here, I thought it would be a good idea to give the site a much-needed refresh.

### So, what’s changed?

Overall, not much. Today’s update is mostly adding content, namely the “About” and “Meet the team!” pages. As of today, we officially have team members and some information about our team.

### What’s next?

Team and robot updates! What good is a blog if it’s never used? Starting now, at the end of the season, we’re going to strive to push out (semi-)regular updates on our team and the robot. Stay tuned for these update posts (that we don’t have a schedule for yet)!
