We are the __Dark Matter Dragons__, team 8806. We are from Seneca Falls, with some members living in Waterloo. The members of our team go to Mynderse Academy in Seneca Falls, P-TECH in Newark and are homeschooled. Our team consists of 7 members with varying levels of experience in FIRST. Four of our members have moved up from the FLL team and have been participating in FIRST programs for between 7 and 8 years. Two of our team members have been doing FTC for the past 3 or 4 years. Our newest team member had shadowed during meetings last season, but has now officially joined us.

During the 2019-2020 FTC season, we have been hard at work to create a robot and accompanying program to achieve the tasks set in this yearâ€™s game. We faced great difficulty in finding time to have meetings, as each of our members are involved in a variety of other activities. Members of our team participate in band, chorus, track and theatre, among other things. We are thankful for the time we do get to meet, and strive to work as efficiently as possible during these meetings.
